# Building a Spam Detector from Scratch Using Machine Learning

According to ANSII (French Information Systems Security Agency) : phishing aims at making the recipient of an apparently legitimate email send his bank data or login credentials to financial services, in order to steal money from him. In addition to phishing, spam emails can also take the form of advertising or a scam also known as "Nigerian Scam". It is acknowledged that 94% of cyberthreats start with an email (source Vade Secure), 67% of ransonware attacks start with a phishing or spam email (Statistica) all this resulting in a loss of $ 1.77 billion for companies in 2019.

We therefore understand that it is necessary to create tools capable of detecting such frauds. In machine learning we call it a binary classification problem, the goal being to say whether or not an email is malicious in view of its content.

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:

- streamlit
- bokeh
- pandas
- seaborn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- PIL
- scipy
- bkharts

The web app is deployed on heroku : https://spam-detecctor-online.herokuapp.com/
